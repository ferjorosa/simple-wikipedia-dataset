  Transform the following text into clean, well-formatted Markdown by following these instructions. Return **only the formatted text** without additional commentary or explanations.

  ### Instructions
  1. **Titles and Headings**
     Convert titles with `=` signs into Markdown headings:
     - `= Title =` → `# Title`
     - `== Subtitle ==` → `## Subtitle`
     - `=== Subtitle ===` → `### Subtitle`
     (Continue this pattern for deeper levels.)

  2. **Line Breaks**
     Add line breaks (`\n`) to separate logical paragraphs and improve readability.

  3. **Lists**
     Use `*` for bulleted lists where the content benefits from structured formatting.

  4. **Code Blocks**
     Enclose code snippets or commands in triple backticks (```).

  5. **Non-English Characters**
     Remove any non-English characters (e.g., Chinese, Cyrillic) to ensure consistency.

  6. **Cleanliness**
     - Remove unnecessary symbols, extra spaces, or formatting artifacts.
     - Ensure the text is polished and free of clutter.

  ### Output Format
  - Return **only the formatted text**.
  - Do not include additional commentary, notes, or explanations.
  - Do not wrap the output in a Markdown code block.
  - Do not add extra titles or subtitles; only convert those indicated by `=` signs.
  - Maintain the heading level specified by the number of `=` signs.
  - Do not include a "References" section
